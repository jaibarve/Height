        <p>Height, according to the dictionary, is the measurement of a person or thing, from the head to toes, or the base to the height. The height of human beings is measured in centimeters or feet and inches. 
            Human height has gradually increased over time, due to better nutrition, healthcare and general quality of life.  
            Our height is based on 2 things. Genetics and environment. 
            Our environment determines how well we develop as people. Countries that are ridden with poverty or war, are often shorter than those in other well off countries like the US or the Netherlands. This is again, due to the change in environment. 	</p>
        <p>The main factor that influences a person’s height is their genetic makeup. However, many other factors can influence height during development, including nutrition, hormones, activity levels, and medical conditions. Height is what is called an "omni-genic trait" which means height is a trait influnced by all of out genes and actions. 

            Scientists say that genetics make up about 86% of our height. Howvever, what makes up the other 20%? As mentioned above, nutrition and out environment can effect our height too! </p>

        <h2>Our Personal Nutrition</h2>
        <img src="malk.jpg" style="float: left; height: 8cm; width: 6cm; padding-right: 0.3cm;">
        <p>Throughout history, we have needed to evolve to become taller. For example, our first ancestors were only about 4 feet tall(about 121 cm). We needed to become taller as we formed hunter and gatherer societies. We needed to become leaner and stand on our hind legs to be able to reach fruits and vegetables that grew on trees. Furthermore, due to us being able to reach these prized fruits and vegetables, the level and amount of nutrition and food we got increases. Therefore make us taller. Nowadays, the average American man is about 5 foot 9 inches tall(179 cm).  During the agricultural revolution, the average European man shrank to 5’5’’ tall. The lower nutrition value of the grain caused the people at the time to lose height.</p> 
        <p>Additionally, when we are still young, maintaining a healthy diet is very important. Food items that strengthen out bones are the best. Foods rich in calcium and protien are the most beneficial if someone wanted to increase their height. Milk and other diary products are good sources of calcium and protiens. Not to mention they also provide us with Vitamin D, potassium and magnesium. Other good foods include:</p> 
        <ul class="table"> 
            <li>Seafood</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Legumes(beans)</li>
            <li>Nuts and seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="kale.jpg" style="float: right;">
        <p>Vegetables are also very powerful food sources. Plants like kale are high in both protiens and calcium. Kale and broccoli are some of the more powerful sources, but for kids that don't eat their broccoli in their brownies, here are some tastier alternatives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oranges!</li>
            <li>Figs</li>
            <li>Salmon</li>
            <li>Sweet Potatoes</li>
            <li>Cheese!(any kind)</li>
        </ul>
        </body>

            <h2 style="text-align: right;"> The Environment in which we live</h2>
            <img src="envir.jpg" style="float: right;">
            <p>Our environment also affects our height. People in higher income countries that are more well off, are tall. The average American man is 5’9'' tall which is not that tall, considering the U.S is one of the richest countries in the world. But both the condition of the environment and nutrition value matter. They are the 12th most obese country, and from abservation, half the money in the U.S. is spent on food, and the other half is spent on losing weight. In the Netherlands, the country which has the tallest average people, has the 18th largest economy in the world. They  are the 99th most obese country, however, they’re spending on fast food and unhealthy food is low. The environment is a combination of out nutrition, surroundings and actions.
            </p>
            <h3 style="padding-top: 2cm;">The Twin Study</h3>
            <p>Identical twins are gentically identical in almost every way. The height of these twins is usually similar, but not the same. Take this for example:
                2 twins are seperated at birth. One is raised in a rich household where they are not meant to work and eat healthy foods. The second is raised of a farm. They work in the feilds and eat protien rich and calcium rich foods to keep up with thier work. Which one would be taller?
            </p>
            <P>Chances are, the farm twin, would be taller. Being taller is also contributed to by regular excersice. Working the feilds gives the twin that excercise. Paired with their diet, the farm twin lives in an environment that will nuture their height. This won't make a drastic difference, becuase they will only grow to an average of their parents heights. But factors like these must be taken into account. </P>

            <h2>Genes and Genetics</h2>
            <p>Our genetics play a huge role in how tall we finally become. As huge as 80%. Our genetics are a combination and mash-up of our parents. Our height is determined by the average of our parents' height. But there are abnormalities when the child grows taller than both their parents and most of their relatives. We look like someone because they have the ‘dominant gene’. However, most of our genes are from our moms. The mother carries the DNA necessary for the mitochondria
            </p>
            <img src="chromy.jpg" alt="Chromosome" style="float: right;">
            <p>The picture above shows a chromosome. We have 46 of those. The chromosomes contain DNA, which is the script for life. Men have XY chromosomes, while women have XX. The reason men are on average taller than women, is because men have the Y chromosome. The Y chromosome is important for deciding the height of a man. More particularly, the HMGA2 gene. </p>
            <p>We know about around 700-800 genes that actually make us taller or shorter. We just don't know which one out of those ~800. Coming back to the HGMA2 gene, having 1 strand of that gene, only makes us 0.3cm taller. But if we follow what we've said before and we inherit 1 from Mom and 1 from Dad, it only explains 0.6 cm of out height. Our genes make up 85% of out height, but those 800 or so genes, only tell us 27% of that 86%. Are we over estimating the importance of genes? Clearly our environment has a massive effect on our height, yet we think it is only 15%. It might be the other way around though.</p>
            <p>Look at this graph:</p>
            <img src="Capture.PNG" style="background-color: white;" alt="height graph">
            <p>The graph describes that South-Koren man is on average taller than North-Korean man. The food shoratge in North Korea, paired with the rampant dictatorship and military lead, amkes it difficult for its citizens to get the proper nutriton to grow. This is why they are shorter. </p>

            <p> In conclusion, I think it might be safe to say, height is a difficult topic. Trying to understand the science behind it, and coping with being vertically challenged. There are so many factors that come together to finally put out a height for our bodies, that we can't understand it. Sure, we could test the DNA and heights of all 7,874,965,825 of us, we would clearly understand what genes effect height. But alas, if the worlds can't come together to fight a global pandemic, why would they to figure out why we are tall?</p>
